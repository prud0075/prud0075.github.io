<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to one of my first websites. My name is Isabelle Prud'homme, I am an 18 year old 1<sup>st</sup> year student at Algonquin College. I am currently studying in IMD (Interactive Media Design). Though I find some parts challenging, I really enjoy being apart of a program where I get to work hands on.</p>
<p> I am a very visual learner and I succeed the most on projects where I get to tap into my visual creativity. Working dominantly with the right side of my brain allows me to express myself in artistic ways. Through <em>photography</em>, <em>videography</em> and <em>visual arts</em>.</p>
<q>The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.</q>
